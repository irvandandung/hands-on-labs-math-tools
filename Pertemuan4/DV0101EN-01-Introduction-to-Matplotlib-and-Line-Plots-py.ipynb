Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shell, the jupyter notebook, web application servers, and four graphical user interface toolkits.\n","\n","If you are aspiring to create impactful visualization with python, Matplotlib is an essential tool to have at your disposal."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"button":false,"deletable":true,"new_sheet":false,"run_control":{"read_only":false},"id":"Xw9RewJWp6dP","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Matplotlib.Pyplot\n","\n","One of the core aspects of Matplotlib is `matplotlib.pyplot`. It is Matplotlib's scripting layer which we studied in details in the videos about Matplotlib. Recall that it is a collection of command style functions that make Matplotlib work like MATLAB. Each `pyplot` function makes some change to a figure: e.g., creates a figure, creates a plotting area in a figure, plots some lines in a plotting area, decorates the plot with labels, etc. In this lab, we will work with the scripting layer to learn how to generate line plots. In future labs, we will get to work with the Artist layer as well to experiment first hand how it differs from the scripting layer. \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"button":false,"deletable":true,"new_sheet":false,"run_control":{"read_only":false},"id":"RTWNFBtdp6dQ","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Let's start by importing `Matplotlib` and `Matplotlib.pyplot` as follows:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"button":false,"deletable":true,"new_sheet":false,"run_control":{"read_only":false},"scrolled":false,"id":"giMZqKnEp6dR","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# we are using the inline backend\n","%matplotlib inline \n","\n","import matplotlib as mpl\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"button":false,"deletable":true,"new_sheet":false,"run_control":{"read_only":false},"id":"urCFQcrtp6dV","colab_type":"text"},"source":["*optional: check if Matplotlib is loaded."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"button":false,"deletable":true,"new_sheet":false,"run_control":{"read_only":false},"scrolled":false,"id":"S8nvnA5mp6dW","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"outputId":"cf8cbd90-a97b-45c4-d73d-d73996a0d161","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1561298804006,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":4592,"user":{"displayName":"Dennis Aprilla Christie","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-W_6VdV2VWBM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAADr0/Jovfu3kCHdA/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"09637515618974467169"}}},"source":["print ('Matplotlib version: ', mpl.__version__) # >= 2.0.0"],"execution_count":31,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Matplotlib version:  3.0.3\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"button":false,"deletable":true,"new_sheet":false,"run_control":{"read_only":false},"id":"zbVgOSq8p6dY","colab_type":"text"},"source":["*optional: apply a style to Matplotlib."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"button":false,"deletable":true,"new_sheet":false,"run_control":{"read_only":false},"scrolled":false,"id":"1f3P1HAPp6dZ","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":54},"outputId":"398e668a-5429-49c9-a638-90524636da26","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1561298804008,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":4592,"user":{"displayName":"Dennis Aprilla Christie","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-W_6VdV2VWBM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAADr0/Jovfu3kCHdA/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"09637515618974467169"}}},"source":["print(plt.style.available)\n","mpl.style.use(['ggplot']) # optional: for ggplot-like style"],"execution_count":32,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["['grayscale', 'fast', 'seaborn-pastel', 'dark_background', 'seaborn-notebook', 'seaborn-deep', 'seaborn-darkgrid', '_classic_test', 'bmh', 'seaborn-dark-palette', 'ggplot', 'classic', 'seaborn-poster', 'tableau-colorblind10', 'seaborn-colorblind', 'Solarize_Light2', 'seaborn-white', 'seaborn-talk', 'seaborn-ticks', 'seaborn-paper', 'seaborn-dark', 'seaborn-whitegrid', 'seaborn', 'fivethirtyeight', 'seaborn-muted', 'seaborn-bright']\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"button":false,"deletable":true,"new_sheet":false,"run_control":{"read_only":false},"id":"npoUbJUHp6dc","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Plotting in *pandas*\n","\n","Fortunately, pandas has a built-in implementation of Matplotlib that we can use.
